        "The aim of this notebook is to implement the Filtering VQE algorithm for solving the VRP. We will not here explain all the algorithm, so just refer to [the original article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10055) to understand it properly. Essentially, a regular VQE would use the expectation value of a hamiltonian $H$ on a quantum parametriced circuit in order to try and minimize that expectation value. What the Filtering VQE will do is use that parametriced circuit in order to approximate the action of some operator $F_\\tau = f(H, \\tau)$ that effectively projects a given wavefunction into lower energy eigenstates, thus, filtering the higher energy eigenstates."

        "Mathematically speaking, the vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial problem, wherein the best routes from a depot to a number of clients and back to the depot are sought, given a number of available vehicles. There are a number of formulations possible, extending a number of formulations of the traveling salesman problem [Applegate et al, 2006]. Here, we present a formulation known as MTZ [Miller, Tucker, Zemlin, 1960]. \n",

Let $x_{ij} = \\{0,1\\}$ be the binary decision variable which, if it is $1$, activates the segment from node $i$ to node $j$. The node index runs from $0$ to $n$, where $0$ is (by convention) the depot. There are twice as many distinct decision variables as edges. For example, in a fully connected graph, there are $n(n+1)$ binary decision variables. \n",
