# 13-Optimizing-logistics-using-quantum-computing

**Name of Mentor:** Pawe≈Ç Gora (Quantum AI Foundation)
**Name of Intern:** Fazli Berk Ordek (Quantum AI Foundation)

**Brief Description:** This project will be a continuation and extension of a QIntern 2021 project aiming to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem and its variants using quantum computing. This time, we will consider new approaches (like local searches and higher-order formulations) and more logistics optimization problems. Scope: (1) Investigating optimization approaches based on local searches www.shorturl.at/mqBE3; (2) Investigating higher-order formulations for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem; (3) Designing QUBO formulations, running experiments with variants of QAOA, VQE and quantum annealing algorithms; (4) Review of logistics optimization problems - intern can review and summarize the existing approaches (Exploring Airline Gate-Scheduling Optimization Using Quantum Computers, Exploring quantum computing use cases for airlines, Airline scheduling problem, Quantum computing approach to railway dispatching and conflict management optimization on single-track railway lines, Optimizing train scheduling, Cargo optimization).
